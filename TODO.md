# To Do
    0) Code cleanup and refactoring.    
    1) When finishes selected tasks, pauses unselected tasks and shuts down the computer. 
    2) Save information about a downloading task in a sqlite3 db until the user explicitly deletes it.
    3) Change the default save path accordingly when the filename changes.
    4) Fix: when can't get file info, the task stucks at starting.
    5) Delete a task without delete the files.
